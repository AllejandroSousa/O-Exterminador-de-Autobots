In the O Exterminador de Autobots, the player controls a spaceship that appears 
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the spaceship left and right
using the arrow keys and shoot using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet
of aliens fill the sky and moves across the screen from side to side and downward.
If the player hits all the aliens, a new fleet, which will move more quickly than
the previous fleet, will appear. If some alien hits the player's spaceship or 
reach the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a spaceship. If the player
loses three spaceships, game over.
